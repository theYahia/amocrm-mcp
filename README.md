## OAuth 2.0 Setup Guide

1. Go to your amoCRM account settings: `https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.amocrm.ru/settings/widgets/`
2. Create a new integration (external integration)
3. Set the redirect URI to `https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.amocrm.ru`
4. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
5. Authorize the integration to get the initial **Authorization Code**
6. Exchange the code for tokens:

```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.amocrm.ru/oauth2/access_token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "grant_type": "authorization_code",
    "code": "YOUR_AUTH_CODE",
    "redirect_uri": "https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.amocrm.ru"
  }'
```

7. Save the `access_token` and `refresh_token` from the response
8. The server will automatically refresh expired tokens if `AMOCRM_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `AMOCRM_CLIENT_ID`, and `AMOCRM_CLIENT_SECRET` are set

## Error Handling

- **401 Unauthorized**: Auto-refreshes token if refresh credentials are configured, then retries
- **429 Rate Limited**: Respects `Retry-After` header, waits and retries
- **5xx Server Errors**: Exponential backoff retry (up to 3 attempts)
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in 150ms delay between requests (~7 req/sec) to stay within amoCRM limits
